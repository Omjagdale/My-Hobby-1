        <p>Coding means using the programming language to get the computer to behave as desired. Each line of the code is a set of instructions for the computer. A set of codes form a script, and a set or dozens of sets, form a program.Put simply, Coding is the a method of communicating with a computer. It is using a language that a computer understands to give a computer instructions in order to perform specific functions. Coding allows us to create things such as computer software, websites, apps and video games.Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website â€“ they're all made with code. Here's a simple example of code, written in the Python language: print 'Hello, world!'.</p>
